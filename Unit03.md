**Unit 3: Customers and Marketing Research** <span id="3"></span> 
*Marketing is all about the customer. But who is the customer? If you
are a car manufacturer, you have multiple types of customers. You might
have governments and rental agencies that wish to buy fleet vehicles. We
call these customers business-to-business (B2B). You would also have
dealerships to whom you want to sell your cars; this is also B2B. Then,
there are the end users, or dealer’s customers. Though the dealer owns
the car when it is sold, the manufacturer almost always plays a crucial
role in the marketing of that car. Identifying your target customer can
be difficult, but with the proper definitions and the right research,
marketers will know their customers better than they know themselves.*

     Instructions: Read this chapter. Please note that pages 91 - 98
    will be a review from Subunit 3.1. The terms *customer* and
    *consumer* are often mistakenly used interchangeably. The
    distinction is blurry because different organizations, academics,
    and governments have varying definitions for both of them. One easy
    way of distinguishing between the two is to think of the consumer as
    a potential customer to a firm and the customer as someone that
    already consumes the goods a specific firm produces. For example, if
    you regularly purchase shoes from Footlocker, you are a Footlocker
    customer. But if your friend does not shop at Footlocker, then
    Footlocker considers him a consumer, i.e., a potential customer.
    Firms often target consumers and existing customers differently.

    defines marketing research this way: “Marketing research is the

    marketer through information - information used to identify and
    define marketing opportunities and problems; generate, refine, and
    evaluate marketing actions; monitor marketing performance; and
    improve understanding of marketing as a process. Marketing research
    specifies the information required to address these issues, designs
    the methods for collecting information, manages, and implements the
    data collection process, and analyzes and communicates the findings
    and their implications.”
