**Unit 1: Marketing Definition and Principles** <span id="1"></span> 
*We will begin with the basics of marketing. In this unit, we will
define a number of important terms and distinguish between marketing,
advertising, and sales. Advertising and sales are two aspects of
marketing, but they come into play much later in the marketing strategy
process. Companies focus on sales and advertising only after all other
factors of marketing have been determined. This unit will teach you that
marketing departments focus on a set of core principles, most of which
are summarized by the 4 Ps (product, price, place, and promotion).*  
  
 *The 4 Ps are also known as the marketing mix. Marketers use the
marketing mix to determine the proper strategy for a product. For
example, if an inventor comes to you with a new touchscreen technology,
how do you sell it? You might first find a product in which the
touchscreen would be useful, such as a phone, then determine a target
price to maximize sales, identify the best place to sell it (e.g. online
or in a store), and finally decide how to promote it. Applying the 4 Ps
in this situation could give you the next iPhone.*

    marketers use integrated marketing communications (IMC) to deliver
    one consistent message to buyers.
