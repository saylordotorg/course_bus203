**Unit 2: Segmenting, Targeting, and Positioning** <span id="2"></span> 
*Philip Kotler, the grand dean of marketing textbooks, has suggested
that if marketers can nail their target and position, all other aspects
of a marketing campaign will fall into place. Target and position define
whom we are trying to reach with our marketing campaign, and what
message (or position) we will use to connect. The concepts of targeting
and positioning are so critical to marketing success that we now
dedicate an entire unit to them.*  
  
 *So let’s now consider the concept of segmenting, targeting, and
positioning (STP), known as the strategic marketing formula that helps
marketers identify and segment their audience, target their market, and
posture their products to cultivate their desired brand position.*
