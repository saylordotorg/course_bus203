**Unit 6: Launching a Marketing Campaign** <span id="6"></span> 
*Marketing is not just a matter of internal strategies and customer
analysis. There are factors outside of the company that must be taken
into consideration with any marketing strategy. Though marketers can
control how they might respond to customer needs and expectations, they
face the often-unpredictable reactions of customers to them. Maintaining
customer satisfaction is essential to sustainable success. Marketers
need to be sensitive to the regulatory and ethical constraints that may
be placed upon them by a wide range of domestic and international
industry standards and the expectations of society.*  
  
 *Companies must also face social forces that challenge their success.
For example, marketers must be aware of the social and cultural aspects
of each region in which they choose to market a product. Even a
worldwide brand such as Coca Cola must adjust its marketing strategy for
every region it enters. An awareness of the cultural factors affecting a
marketing strategy can make the marketing message much more effective.
Quite often marketers will address social issues especially relevant to
lives of their audiences or the larger society with social marketing
campaigns.*  
  
 *Finally, as a marketing campaign prepares for its launch, all the
issues addressed in this and earlier units must come together in a
formalized document - the comprehensive marketing plan.*
