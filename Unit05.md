**Unit 5: Distribution and Promotion** <span id="5"></span> 
*Once marketers have identified the right product and determined
appropriate pricing, they must decide how to effectively raise awareness
and distribute the product. This unit will focus on these decisions. You
will learn that distribution is a complex process that involves taking a
product through the manufacturing process, shipping to warehouses,
distributing to sellers and customers, and taking returned products.
Marketers must work with supply chain managers to determine the best
method to route products. If marketers expect that sales will be heavier
in the northeast than in the west, additional resources will need to be
allocated there to meet demand. There are a number of strategies for
moving a product through various distribution channels. These vary based
on anticipated demand, actual demand, and the competition. Marketers
must have a proactive strategy: They cannot sit on inventory and wait
for orders because inventory storage is expensive and a lack of sales is
disruptive.*  
  
 *The final and arguably most vital aspect of marketing is the actual
promotion of the product. This can take for the form of giveaways,
competitions, advertising, sales, and anything else a creative manager
can think of. Marketers must take a number of aspects into
consideration, however. *  
  
 *If you employ a sales staff to promote the product, how do you
compensate them? If you pay a commission, how much commission will be
paid per unit? Will the sales staff be given discretion on price, or do
you want to send a uniform message that the price is locked in? If a new
company has limited funds available for advertising campaigns, might
they use public relations tactics to gain free media coverage?*  
  
 *These are just a few considerations that marketers must consider. This
final unit will provide you with the tools you need to make the best
possible promotion decisions.*

**5.1 Distribution Channel Strategies** <span id="5.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: University of Georgia: John Burnett’s *Core Concepts of
    Marketing*: “Chapter 10: Channel Concepts: Distributing the
    Product”**
    Link: University of Georgia: John Burnett’s *Core Concepts
    of* *Marketing:* [“Chapter 10: Channel Concepts: Distributing the
    Product”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/BUS203-5.1_Channel-concepts.pdf) (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read Chapter 10. Note that the push and pull
    strategies are based on how the customer perceives a product. For
    example, if the company really wants to sell a product, it may
    aggressively push it through the distribution channel and into
    stores with pricing incentives. This strategy is often seen with
    products for which the customer does not yet have a perceived need
    or desire. A pull strategy is based on satisfying a customer’s want
    or need. It is almost as if the customer is pulling the product
    through the distribution channel. Channel membership is a
    distribution strategy based on the type of product in question. If
    quality and reliability is important, marketers will use exclusive
    distributions, i.e. *authorized resellers*. An intensive
    distribution is the opposite; a marketer will allow just about
    anyone to carry a product. Convenience foods are a good example:
    just about every checkout line in a store now carries snacks and
    sodas.

     Instructions: Read this chapter, which explains that a direct
    marketing channel consists of just two parties: the producer and the
    consumer. By contrast, a channel that includes one or more
    intermediaries (wholesalers, distributors, brokers, or agents) is an
    indirect channel. Firms often utilize multiple channels to reach
    more customers and increase their effectiveness. Some companies find
    ways to increase their sales by forming strategic channel alliances
    with one another. Other companies look for ways to cut out the
    middlemen from the channel, a process known as disintermediation.
    Direct foreign investment, joint ventures, exporting, franchising,
    and licensing are some of the channels by which firms attempt to
    enter foreign markets.

**5.2 Promotion Tools and Tactics** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*Promotion gets to the heart of a marketing campaign. Once you have
developed your product or service, identified a target audience, and
constructed a selling proposition, now comes the time to let the world
know about it. This may be accomplished through a number of means
ranging from paid advertising to public relations outreach to direct
sales. This subunit provides useful detail on this most critical “P” of
the marketing mix.*

    releases, sponsorships, and product placements are three commonly
    used PR tools. Press releases are designed to generate publicity,
    but there is no guarantee the media will use them in the stories
    they write. Sponsorships are designed to increase brand awareness,
    improve corporate image, and reach target markets. Product
    placements are designed to generate exposure, brand awareness, and
    interest.

    elsewhere in the course for specific examples supporting subunit
    topics ahead, but for now it provides a useful overview of the
    public relations craft and some tools at its disposal. This primer
    was prepared to help government and business leaders in the former
    Soviet Union make the transition from a centralized system to a
    market system, where they were expected to interact with a freer and
    more independent media. The concept of *public and media
    relations*was new to many of these leaders, so this primer provides

    already, you will need to create a free account at the link above to

    -   Observe an advertising campaign for a new product or service.
        Did you notice the same product or service advertised in
        different media? Who was the target audience? What was the
        marketing message? Why did the marketers select the particular
        medium (or media)?  
          
    -   Think of a product or service you might promote with your own
        marketing plan. Who will be your target audience? What media
        will you select and why? What might your marketing message be?  
          
    -   Find an example of a marketing campaign that may have relied
        more on public relations and free media placements than on a
        paid advertising campaign. Assess it for its strategies and
        effectiveness.
