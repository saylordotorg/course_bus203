**Unit 4: Life Cycles, Offers, Supply Chains, and Pricing** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Products do not last forever. New products typically cost more than
existing products due to the high costs associated with production and
development- this is best illustrated by technology products. The fact
that initial customers will be early adopters of a new product affects
the marketing strategy. As the product grows and matures, the strategy
again changes; over time, marketers lower the price. When a product is
in the declining stage, most competitors leave the market and prices are
very low. At each stage, the marketing of the product is different.  
  
 When a new product is developed and offered, a company must consider
what will develop the product's value to the customer, whether the
customer is a consumer or another business. Marketers must always ask
where a new product will fit in their current lineup and how the new
product will serve as an extension of an existing brand. Take the car
manufacturer BMW. They make sporty luxury vehicles aimed at the
upper-middle and wealthy classes.*  
  
 *Developing an inexpensive and lower-quality vehicle to compete with
cars in another class may dilute the brand and hurt sales. However, if
BMW were to market the vehicle under a different brand, they could
diversify their product portfolio, avoid the risk of diluting the BMW
brand, and be able to reach new customers all at the same time. Some
firms go to great lengths to disassociate their brands from one another,
while others embrace a family of brands model. Appropriate decisions
vary by industry and strategy.*  
  
 *Equally important in delivering value to the customer through an
offering is how a company sources the goods and services necessary for
production and delivers the end product for customers to purchase -
otherwise known as the supply chain.*  
  
 *Finally in this unit, we will examine issues in pricing, including the
costs of delivering a product, customer and societal perspectives, the
impacts of competition, and ultimately the revenues a company may
generate.*
