Course Syllabus for "BUS203: Principles of Marketing"
-----------------------------------------------------

In this course, you will learn about the marketing process and examine
the range of marketing decisions that an organization must make in order
to sell its products and services. You will also learn how to think like
a marketer, discovering that the focus of marketing has always been on
the consumer. You will begin to ask, “Who is the consumer of goods and
services?” What does the consumer need? What does the consumer want?
Marketing is an understanding of how to communicate with the consumer,
and is characterized by four activities:
-   Creating products and services that serve consumers
-   Communicating a clear value proposition
-   Delivering products and services in a way that optimizes value
-   Exchanging, or trading, value for those offerings

Many people incorrectly believe that marketing and advertising are one
in the same. In reality, advertising is just one of many tools used in
marketing, which is the process by which firms determine which products
to offer, how to price those products, and to whom they should be made
available. We will also explore various ways in which marketing
departments and independent agencies answer these questions - whether
through research, analysis, or even trial-and-error. Once a company
identifies its customer and product, marketers must then determine the
best way to capture the customer’s attention. Capturing the customer’s
attention may entail undercutting competitors on price, aggressively
marketing a product with promotions and advertising (as with “As Seen on
TV” ads), or specifically targeting ideal customers. The strategy a
marketing firm chooses for a particular product is vital to the success
of the product. The idea that “great products sell themselves” is simply
not true. By the end of this course, you will be familiar with the art
and science of marketing a product. **This course provides students the
